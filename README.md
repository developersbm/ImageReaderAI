<!-- INSPIRATION -->
## Inspiration

- With the evolution of AI, I want to create a more sophisticated way to analyze objects and allow users to maximize their information knowledge and time. Using my application will enable users to take a picture or choose a view from the gallery to access an AI that will answer questions based on the user's prompt and image. 
- For example, let's say you are at a museum and like a painting. With ImageReaderAI, you can take a picture and get instant information on whatever aspect of the painting you choose.
